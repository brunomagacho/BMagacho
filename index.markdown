### Bio

| Hello everyone, my name is Bruno Magacho da Silva, I'm a PhD student at the [Physics Institute from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.if.ufrj.br/), in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. My main research activities are related to magnetohydrodynamic simulations with the Lattice Boltzmann Method, which I implement using the high level Python Language with an optimization library called numba to make CPU and GPU parallelization. I also perform the statistical analysis of a large experiment to investigate the intriguing coherent structures in a turbulent pipe flow.|

 



Fell free to email me at `magacho@pos.if.ufrj.br` if you have any questions.
